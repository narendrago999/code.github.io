        <h3>Water Level Controller using 8051 Microcontroller</h3>
        <p>
          Here we are designing the circuit which is used to detect and control
          the water level automatically in overhead tank using 8051
          microcontroller. It is used in industries to control the liquid level
          automatically.

        <h3>Car Parking Guard Circuit Using Infrared Sensor</h3>
        <p>
            While parking the car the driver should be more careful because he cannot see the back of the car while parking or taking reverse, if there is any obstacle and ran over it might be  get damage to the car. Our project will help the person in the driving seat and give alarm if there is any obstacle or a wall while parking or while driving in reverse.

        <h3>Cell Phone Detector Circuit</h3>
        <p>
            The most common electronic equipment used now-a-days is Cell Phone or Mobile Phone. With advancement in communication technology, the requirement of cell phones has increased dramatically. A cell phone typically transmits and receives signals in the frequency range of 0.9 to 3GHz. This article provides a simple circuit to detect the presence of an activated cell phone by detecting these signals.

        <h3>Automatic Washroom Light Switch</h3>
        <p>
            In this project, I will show you how to design and build a simple Automatic Washroom Light Switch Circuit, which will automatically turn on the when you enter the washroom and turns it off when you leave.
            We turn on the lights in our washroom when we enter it and turn them off when we leave. Sometimes, we forget to turn the lights off after leaving the washroom.

        <h3>Automatic Door Bell With Object Detection</h3>
        <p>
            We all have a doorbell at our homes. When a visitor comes to our house, he searches for the doorbell switch and then rings it to let us know his presence. If the who came to our house cannot find the doorbell or else if the person is so short that he cannot reach the doorbell, what can be done? How will it be if we use an automatic doorbell which rings as soon as a person arrives at our place? There are no more hassles. The person who comes to our house need not search for the doorbell and press it any more. If we install this automatic doorbell using object detection circuit, the circuit will automatically sense the presence of the person and it rings the doorbell.

        <h3>GSM Controlled Robot using Microcontroller</h3>
        <p>
            The GSM modem which is fixed at the robot receives the messages sent by the mobile and gives the instructions to the microcontroller to control the robot directions. In this project, we interface 8051 microcontroller with GSM SIM 300. The protocol used for the communication between controller and GSM modem is UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter). This system continuously checks for message to take the decision for controlling the robot.

        <h3>USB Mobile Charger Circuit</h3>
        <p>
            Now the charging of your mobiles has been made easy with the help of USB outlets present in the Laptop and PC. For the charging of your mobile phone, this circuit provides you a regulated voltage of 4.7 volts. 5  volts of DC voltage and 100mA of current is being provided by the USB outlet which is well enough for the mobile phone charging slowly. We can use this circuit to charge the mobile while we are in journey also. So, we may treat it as Mobile Phone Travel Charger Circuit.

        <h3>Street Lights that Glow on Detecting Vehicle Movement</h3>
        <p>
            Generally, street lights are switched on for whole night and during the day, they are switched off. But during the night time, street lights are not necessary if there is no traffic. Saving of this energy is very important factor these days as energy resources are getting reduced day by day.
