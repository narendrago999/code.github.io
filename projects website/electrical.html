            <h3> AC Power Controller With Programmable Interface</h3>
            <p>The project aims at controlling the AC power by using the concept of firing angle control of thyristors. One can enter the required percentage of power supply through a keypad. The input is provided to a microcontroller of 8051 family that initiate the firing angle to adjust the load power. For matching the power to the required one, a TRIAC is used in series with the AC load. A LCD screen is used to display the power percentage that is provided by the user.</p>

            <h3>Solar Powered Battery Charging With Reverse Current Protection</h3>
            <p>Solar energy is a very efficient source of green energy that is available for free. But it needs to be coupled with proper storage for best use. Also to store it we need to use charge controlling circuitry to protect panel from reverse currents as well as to charge the battery efficiently. So we demonstrate this concept by using a mini solar panel to charge a rechargeable pencil cell battery. Also we use a charge control circuit designed to stop reverse current flow and charge the battery effectively using the solar panel. Thus this allows us to effectively provide solar battery charging with reverse current protection.</p>

            <h3>Automatic Smoke Detector Alarm</h3>
            <p>The Automatic Smoke Detector Alarm is very compact as it doesnâ€™t employs the costly smoke detecting sensors. It has pair of infrared sensors which are continuously monitoring the visibility in the premises where they are attached. In case a fire erupts, smoke gets generated and spreads in and around the premises. Once this smoke reaches the smoke detector module the visibility of the infrared sensors get obstructed. T</p>
