        <h3>DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A WEB BASED HALL ALLOCATION SYSTEM FOR EXAMINATION</h3>
        <p>
            Presently in today’s institution, there is a geometric rise in the number of students admitted with a ration in the number for each department and level of study. This variation in the number of students has posed a problem in allocating halls into consideration for examination. Based on this, there is a so much need for a system that would alleviate such problem.

        <h3>DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CYBERCAFE SECURITY</h3>
        <p>
            This research work came to existence the time when internet café business is becoming very popular and vast. The principal objective of this project is to stop or deny access to an unauthorized user and also to ensure proper accountability of cash received by the ticketers. Therefore the design and development of this internet security package for Access Point Limited is worthwhile.

        <h3>A CLUSTERING BASED WEB PREFETCHING IN HIGH TRAFFIC ENVIRONMENT</h3>
        <p>
            The continued increase in demand for objects on the Internet causes high web traffic and consequently low user response time which is one of the major bottleneck in the network world. Increase in bandwidth is a possible solution to the problem but it involves increasing economic cost. An alternative solution is web prefetching. Web prefetching is the process of predicting and fetching web pages in advance by proxy server before a request is sent by a user. Prefetching is performed during the server idle time. Most literature based on the classical prefetch algorithm assumes that the server idle time is large enough to prefetch all user’s predicted requests which is not true in a real life situation. This research aims at improving the web prefetching technique by developing a prefetching technique that can be effective in a high traffic environment when the server idle time is very low.Log files were collected and preprocessed for several client group within a domain.

        <h3>DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A CERTIFICATE VERIFICATION SYSTEM</h3>
        <p>
            Certificate verification system is a system designed to computerize the process of adding certificates and verifying the certificates records considering the problems faced by doing this manually. The system was studied and relevant officials were interviewed to acquire the required data. This designed system allows for easy retrieval of information that is accurate for effective and efficient allocations. It has easy maintenance of information as well as time saving and reduction in operation. The system designed in HTML, CSS and PHP is interactive, menu-driven and user friendly. It provides timely information about certificates. Most certificates operations are recorded and stored in the computer and retrieved at will. It ensures security as the user must login before and any certificate is added or printed.
