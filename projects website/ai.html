        <h3>DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN AUTOMATIC STREET LIGHTING SYSTEM USING IOT</h3>
        <p>
            The internet has always been a joy to the world since the early 1990s. It has now brought about one of its most revolutionary implementations which is the “Internet-of-Things”. The internet of things paradigm is a wireless connection based system that facilitates the building of smart systems like smart homes and now a smart street light.

        <h3>ARCHITECTURAL PATTERN FOR SCHEDULING MULTI-COMPONENT APPLICATIONS IN DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS</h3>
        <p>
            Scheduling in distributed systems generally aims to leverage the power of diverse heterogeneous, geographically distributed, multiple-domain-spanning computational resource to provide optimal system performance, high throughput computing and maximum resource utilization. To achieve this goal, an efficient and effective scheduling system is fundamentally important. However, it is very difficult to do this using the traditional off-the-shelf scheduling software. Many issues have to be treated, such as, poor system design, limitation in heuristic-based implementation, system adaptability and scalability.

        <h3>AN IMPROVED JOB SCHEDULING ALGORITHM IN GRID COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT USING FAULT TOLERANCE MECHANISMS</h3>
        <p>
            Grid scheduler, schedules user jobs on the best available resource in terms of resource characteristics by optimizing time, and resource failure in grid is no longer an exception but a regular event. Andresources are increasinglybeing used by the scientific community to solve computationallyintensive problems which typically run for days oreven months.It is therefore absolutely essential that long-running applications are able to tolerate failures and avoid computation of the task from scratch when resource failure occurred, to satisfy the user‟s QoS requirement.An Improved Job Scheduling Algorithm in Grid Computing Environment Using Fault Tolerance Mechanisms is proposed...

        <h3>DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SEARCH ENGINE SYSTEM</h3>
        <p>
            A search engine is an information retrieval system designed to help find information stored on a computer system. The search results are usually presented in a list and are commonly called hits. Search engines help to minimize the time required to find information and the amount of information which must be consulted, akin to other techniques for managing information overload. Search engines provide an interface to a group of items that enables users to specify criteria about an item of interest and have the engine find the matching items.

        <h3>Plagiarism Analyzer</h3>
        <p>
            On the internet, plagiarism is widespread. The internet is brimming with content, which can be found on millions of different websites. It can be tough to tell which content is plagiarised and which is not at times. Authors of blog postings should check to see if their work has been stolen and put elsewhere. News organizations should investigate whether a content farm has stolen their news pieces and claimed them as their own. The task is demanding. What if you had your own plagiarism detection software? This opportunity is provided by AI....

        <h3>Prediction Bird Species</h3>
        <p>
            Manual classification of birds can be done by topic experts, but it has become a hard and time-consuming process due to the vast accumulation of data. Artificial intelligence-based categorization becomes critical in this situation. This classification-based AI project can be approached in two ways. If you’re a newbie, you can use a random forest to forecast bird species. To get to an intermediate level, you can utilize a convolution neural network.

        <h3>Face Recognition</h3>
        <p>
            Facial recognition is a technique for recognizing or verifying a person’s identification by looking at their face. This technology can recognize persons in photographs, videos, and in real-time. A type of biometric security is facial recognition. Although there is growing interest in other applications, the technology is mostly employed for security and law enforcement. Typically, face recognition does not need a large database of images to identify an individual’s identification; rather, it merely identifies and recognizes one person as the device’s only owner, while restricting access to others.
